# Lotris — Project Context

> Last updated: May 2026 — Sprint 16 complete (QA fixes: Queue role-scope, Tickets/Tasks role banners, Monitor real DB; animated ticker; light/dark toggle; cross-team access; mobile CSS; KPI My Agreement for engineers/team leads; TEAM_LEAD agreement builder access; Daily measurement period; submit-for-review button improvements)

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Lotris** is a multi-tenant Help Desk Ticket and KPI Management System built for IT customer support teams. It combines real-time ticket tracking, team queue management, engineer workload balancing, KPI-driven performance tracking, and advanced reporting into a single admin platform — designed for speed, clarity, and daily support operations.

**Tagline:** _"Where performance surfaces."_
**Pronunciation:** _LOH-tris_
**Positioning:** Enterprise performance management for IT and operations teams.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

IT support teams operate under constant pressure:

- Tickets pile up with no structured queue or controlled ownership
- SLA breaches are discovered after the fact, not prevented
- Engineer workloads are unbalanced with no visibility into capacity
- KPI targets exist on spreadsheets with no real-time tracking
- Management reports are manually compiled, inconsistent, and delayed

Lotris solves this with a single system where every ticket is queued, assigned, escalated, and reported automatically — and every performance target is tracked in real time.

## 5. Ticket Lifecycle

```
NEW → TEAM_ASSIGNED → UNASSIGNED → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → ESCALATED → RESOLVED → CLOSED
```

### Assignment Flow

**Phase 1 — Team Routing**

- Ticket is assigned to a Team queue
- No engineer assigned yet (status: `UNASSIGNED`)

**Phase 2 — Controlled Pickup**

- Engineers can claim tickets from the queue
- System enforces: max workload, queue visibility, priority ordering

**Phase 2b — Admin / Team Lead Direct Assign**

- `ADMIN`, `SUPERADMIN`, and `TEAM_LEAD` roles can directly assign any ticket to an engineer from the ticket detail drawer
- The system auto-walks the state machine: `NEW → TEAM_ASSIGNED → UNASSIGNED → ASSIGNED` — all intermediate steps fire their normal SLA timers, history entries, and notifications
- Re-assigning an already-`ASSIGNED` ticket is supported; triggers a fresh `TICKET_ASSIGNED` notification

**Phase 3 — Auto-Assignment (SLA fallback)**

- If ticket is not picked within Pickup SLA: system auto-assigns to least-loaded engineer
- Round-robin fallback if loads are equal

**Phase 4 — SLA Escalation**

- Pickup SLA breach → auto-assign + manager notification
- Resolution SLA breach → escalation + alerts

---

## 6. KPI System

Lotris structures KPI management across three layers, separating global configuration from team-level assignment and individual performance agreements.

---

### Layer 1 — KPI Definitions `(IT Manager → 06-kpi-setup)`

The IT Manager creates and manages KPI definitions globally for the organisation. Each definition specifies:

- **Name & description** — what is being measured
- **Metric type** — percentage, time (hrs/min), count, score
- **Target value** — threshold for green/amber/red
- **Direction** — higher is better or lower is better
- **Scope** — Org-wide, Team-level, or Individual (Engineer)
- **Weight** — contribution to composite KPI score (must total 100 across active definitions)
- **Status** — Active or Draft

The manager can also set per-team target overrides in a matrix view (e.g. one team has a tighter SLA target than another).

| KPI Definition          | Scope      | Default Target | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------ |
| SLA Compliance Rate     | Team / Org | ≥ 95%          | 20%    |
| Pickup SLA Adherence    | Team       | ≥ 90%          | 15%    |
| First Response Time     | Team / Org | ≤ 2 hrs        | 15%    |
| Avg Resolution Time     | Team       | ≤ 4 hrs        | 15%    |
| Engineer Productivity   | Individual | ≥ 30 / month   | 20%    |
| CSAT Score              | Team       | ≥ 4.2 / 5.0    | 10%    |
| Recurring Incident Rate | Org        | ≤ 10%          | 5%     |
| Workload Distribution   | Team       | ≥ 75 score     | —      |

---

### Layer 2 — KPI Assignment `(Team Lead → 07-team-kpi-setup)`

Team Leads work within the active KPI definitions set by the Manager. For each review period they:

- **Assign** specific KPIs to each engineer in their team (not every engineer needs every KPI)
- **Override targets** per engineer where appropriate (e.g. senior engineer has a higher SLA target; junior has a lower productivity threshold)
- Override inputs show the team default as a reference and the individual override value is clearly flagged
- Any KPI not assigned to an engineer is excluded from their score calculation

This layer is scoped to the Team Lead’s own team. KPI definitions and global weights are read-only here.

---

### Layer 3 — KPI Agreement `(Team Lead + Engineer → 08-kpi-agreement)`

For each review period a Team Lead builds a formal **KPI Agreement** with an individual engineer — a structured performance contract that both parties sign off on before the period begins.

Agreements are organised into **KPI Areas**, each containing multiple **Metric Rows**:

| Column                               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimum Performance Metrics Standard | Full prose description of the expected standard                  |
| Weight                               | Numeric weight for this metric within the total (all must = 100) |
| Measurement Period                   | `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, or `ANNUALLY` — configurable per row |
| Target / Score                       | Specific target value for the review period                      |

Example structure for a DB Engineer agreement (total weight = 100):

| KPI Area                 | Metrics | Weight |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Product Quality          | 8       | 50.0   |
| Professional Development | 3       | 30.0   |
| Customer Focus           | 2       | 20.0   |

**Entry modes:**

- **Manual entry** — Team Lead types or pastes in each metric row directly in the system
- **Document upload** — Upload an Excel/CSV file; the system parses columns with a mapping wizard and shows a preview before import

**Sign-off flow:**

1. Team Lead builds the agreement (status: `DRAFT`)
2. Lead uses "Send to member for review" button — status changes to `PENDING_REVIEW`
3. Engineer views their own agreement at `/kpis/my-agreement` and accepts ("Accept & Sign Off") — status changes to `ACTIVE`
4. Active agreements are the basis for KPI tracking and scoring throughout the period

**Role access to agreements:**
- `SUPERADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `IT_MANAGER`, `TEAM_LEAD` — full agreement builder at `/kpis/agreements` (controlled via `kpiAgreementProcedure`)
- `TEAM_LEAD`, `ENGINEER` — read-only My Agreement view at `/kpis/my-agreement`; engineer can accept `PENDING_REVIEW` agreements

---

### KPI Tracking & Scoring _(Phase 2)_

During the review period, actuals are logged against each metric. At the end of the period the system calculates a weighted score per KPI Area and an overall performance score, which feeds into the engineer’s appraisal record.

```

**No single point of failure:** each process is independently deployable, restartable, and scalable. BullMQ workers resume queued jobs from Redis on restart — no data loss. Docker/ECS auto-restarts crashed containers.

### Core Components

**Ticket Engine** — Lifecycle management, comments, attachments, audit trail

**Queue Engine** _(critical)_ — Team queues, ticket ordering by priority + SLA, pickup SLA tracking, auto-assignment logic

**KPI Engine** — KPI definition per engineer/team, real-time + batch computation, scoring

**Notification Engine** — Email + in-app alerts, SLA breach and escalation notifications

**Analytics Layer** — Pre-aggregated data for fast dashboard queries and scheduled reports

**Health Monitor** — 1-second health pings to all processes; SSE stream to SysAdmin ops dashboard; restart API with audit log

---

## 9. Data Model (High-Level)

**Core ticket entities:**
Tenants · Users (Engineers) · Roles · Teams · Tickets · Ticket_Comments · Tasks · Task_Assignments · Task_Checklist_Items · Notifications · Audit_Logs · Assignment_History · Queue_Config

> **Tasks** carry a `source` field (`LEAD_ASSIGNED | SELF_LOGGED`) and a `created_by` FK. Self-logged tasks are visible to the team lead and feed KPI actuals the same way lead-assigned tasks do.

**KPI entities:**
KPI_Definitions · KPI_Team_Targets · KPI_Engineer_Assignments · KPI_Agreements · KPI_Agreement_Areas · KPI_Agreement_Metrics · KPI_Results · KPI_Actuals

**Key relationships:**

- `KPI_Definitions` → global library managed by IT Manager
- `KPI_Team_Targets` → per-team overrides on a KPI definition
- `KPI_Engineer_Assignments` → which KPIs are active for an engineer in a period + individual target overrides
- `KPI_Agreements` → one agreement per engineer per review period; has a status (Draft / Pending Review / Active)
- `KPI_Agreement_Areas` → named KPI areas within an agreement (e.g. Product Quality)
- `KPI_Agreement_Metrics` → individual metric rows: description, weight, period, target, actual score
- `KPI_Results` → computed weighted scores per area and overall, per period

---

## 10. Multi-Tenancy

- Each organisation = Tenant; all tables include `tenant_id`
- Shared DB (SaaS default) or Dedicated DB (enterprise option)
- Per-tenant config: SLA rules, KPI definitions, workflow rules

---

## 11. Development Roadmap & Build Plan

### Guiding Principles

- Build the **Queue Engine** first among the domain modules — it is the most complex and most critical
- Auth and multi-tenancy must be in place before any other module
- The KPI Engine depends on real ticket and task data — build it last in Phase 1
- Every sprint delivers a working vertical slice, not back-end scaffolding alone

| Dark mode         | **next-themes**              | `ThemeProvider attribute="class"`; `localStorage`-backed; Moon/Sun toggle in topbar |

**Rendering strategy:**

- Static pages (login, marketing) → SSG, served from CDN edge
- Data pages (tickets, tasks, KPIs) → React Server Components — HTML on first load, zero JS for static parts
- Interactive components (drawers, forms, live panels) → Client Components

**Responsive + PWA strategy:**

- **Desktop (1280px+)** — full sidebar, table views, multi-column layouts — primary engineer and lead experience
- **Tablet (768–1279px)** — sidebar collapses to icon rail; tables scroll horizontally; drawers full-height
- **Mobile (<768px)** — sidebar becomes bottom nav; tables become card stacks; drawers become full-screen sheets; KPI widgets stack vertically
- **PWA** — `next-pwa` manifest; installable on iOS/Android home screen; offline shell via service worker; push notifications (Android; iOS 16.4+)
- Native mobile app deferred — revisit only if a specific role (e.g. field engineers) drives clear demand post-launch

| Monitoring     | **Health check API + SSE**        | 1s health pings per service; SysAdmin ops dashboard (page 10); public status page (`status.lotris.io`)                 |
| Notifications  | **Nodemailer + SSE**              | Email dispatch in BullMQ worker; in-app SSE stream per user                                                            |

**Key backend decisions:**

- NestJS on **Fastify** from day one — not retrofitted
- **Drizzle** over TypeORM/Prisma — explicit SQL, no query magic, 7 KB runtime
- **tRPC** for all internal Next.js ↔ NestJS calls; REST only for external consumers
- **Redis mutex locks** on auto-assignment jobs to prevent race conditions
- **Dashboard cache layer** — metrics pre-computed on write, served from Redis on read (<100ms)
- **Auth boundary** — Clerk owns identity verification; NestJS guard verifies Clerk JWT and issues a scoped internal JWT with `{ tenantId, role }` claims; Clerk `Organization` maps to Lotris tenant

### Build Sequence

#### Sprint 1–2 · Foundation

**Deliverable:** Working auth, tenant scaffold, user & team management, frontend shell

| Task                                            | Notes                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DB schema — tenants, users, roles, teams        | Multi-tenant from day 1; all tables carry `tenant_id`                                      |
| Auth — Clerk; Google + Microsoft social login   | OIDC + SAML available for enterprise tenants; Clerk `Organization` = Lotris tenant         |
| NestJS auth guard                               | Verifies Clerk JWT on every protected route; issues internal JWT with `{ tenantId, role }` |
| JIT user provisioning via Clerk webhook         | User created in Lotris on first Clerk login; `clerk_user_id` stored on user record         |
| User management API (CRUD)                      | Avatar, role, team assignment, status; `clerk_user_id` → `external_id` field               |
| Team management API                             | Create teams, assign lead, add/remove members                                              |
| Next.js scaffold — App Router, layouts, sidebar | Port mockup tokens to `tailwind.config.ts`; add ShadCN base components                     |
| Login screen (01) wired to Clerk `<SignIn />`   | Role-based redirect post-login; drop-in component                                          |

> **Task modes:** Team Leads assign tasks to one or more engineers. Engineers can also open the drawer in **self-log mode** to record their own tasks — these are visible to their lead and contribute to KPI actuals the same way lead-assigned tasks do.

## 16. Local Development Environment

### Process Manager

All services run under **pm2** in local dev:

| pm2 ID | Name         | Port | Restart behaviour            |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| 0      | `lotris-api` | 4000 | tsx watch — auto-reloads on file save |
| 6      | `lotris-web` | 3000 | Next.js HMR — hot-reloads on file save |

pm2 binary: `/Users/kwekku/.nvm/versions/node/v24.13.0/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2`  
Next.js started with `-H 0.0.0.0` to bind on LAN. Current dev LAN IP: `192.168.8.133`.

### Dev Login Users

Development shortcut: `GET /api/dev-login?user={alias}` — sets a Clerk-compatible dev session without social login.

| Alias  | Role        | Notes                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| yaw    | ENGINEER    | Standard engineer scope        |
| kofi   | TEAM_LEAD   | DB/IT team                     |
| kwame  | SUPERADMIN  | Full access                    |
| abena  | ADMIN       | Tenant admin                   |
| fatima | IT_MANAGER  | KPI definitions, oversight     |

### Database

- **MSSQL** connection string: `mssql://sa:Lotris@Dev2024!@localhost:1433/lotris`
- Snake_case column names throughout. Key column: `sla_resolution_deadline` (not `sla_deadline`).
- Priority values: `1 = Critical, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low` — always `ORDER BY priority ASC`.
- 347 tickets in local dev DB; 204 open; 187 SLA breached.
- MSSQL reserved keyword `open` — use alias `openCount` in raw SQL.

### CSS Design System

The live implementation uses the **v2 CSS design system** ported from `mockups/style-v2.css` into `apps/web/app/globals.css`. Most page components use v2 CSS classes (e.g. `v2-card`, `v2-btn`, `v2-stats-grid`). The Monitor page uses 100% inline styles. Tailwind is configured but the primary styling approach in built components is the v2 CSS class system.

### tRPC Procedure Middleware

| Procedure | Allowed roles | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `publicProcedure` | anyone (no auth) | Monitor stats, public endpoints |
| `protectedProcedure` | any authenticated user | Tickets, tasks, own user data |
| `managerProcedure` | SUPERADMIN, ADMIN, IT_MANAGER | Reporting, config |
| `adminProcedure` | SUPERADMIN, ADMIN | User management, destructive ops |
| `kpiAgreementProcedure` | SUPERADMIN, ADMIN, IT_MANAGER, TEAM_LEAD | KPI agreement builder (create, setAreas) |

### tRPC Client Pattern

`AppRouter` in `@lotris/types` is typed as `any` to avoid complex type propagation. All tRPC calls use **bracket notation** to avoid TypeScript errors:

```ts
trpc['users.me'].useQuery()
trpc['tickets.list'].useQuery({ page: 1, limit: 25 })
trpc['kpi.agreements.list'].useQuery({ engineerId: me.id })
```

### Monitor Page

- URL: `/monitor` — **public route** (no Clerk auth required)
- `middleware.ts` includes `/monitor(.*)` in `publicRoutes`
- Uses `MonitorProviders` (lightweight tRPC + QueryClient, no auth token)
- Queries `monitor.stats` tRPC procedure (also public/unauthenticated)
- Features: real-time stat cards, animated priority ticker (20 tickets), light/dark theme toggle (persisted via `localStorage`)

## 17. Out of Scope (v1)

- Customer-facing self-service portal
- Native mobile app — deferred; responsive PWA covers all roles in v1; revisit if field engineers drive specific demand
- Real-time chat / live support
- Billing / subscription management
- Prometheus / Grafana / Datadog integrations (Phase 3)
