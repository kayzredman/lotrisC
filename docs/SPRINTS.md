### Backend Dev Agent Jobs
- [x] `B5-1` — MSSQL schema: `queue_configs` table (`max_capacity_per_engineer`, `pickup_sla_minutes`, `resolution_sla_minutes`, `auto_assign_enabled`, nullable `team_id`). Migration: `0003_queue_engine.sql`
- [x] `B5-2` — `QueueModule` REST v1: `GET /api/v1/queue` (engineer queue), `POST /api/v1/queue/claim/:ticketId` (controlled pickup with capacity check), `GET /api/v1/queue/health` (status counts + SLA breach + workload), `GET|PATCH /api/v1/queue/config` (ADMIN)
- [x] `B5-3` — `sla-timers.worker.ts`: BullMQ worker handling `pickup-sla-check` (marks breach, triggers auto-assign) and `resolution-sla-check` (marks breach, escalates, notifies manager)
- [x] `B5-4` — `auto-assign.worker.ts`: least-loaded engineer algorithm, Redis mutex `SET auto-assign:lock:{ticketId} NX EX 10000`, fallback on all-at-capacity, enqueues resolution SLA + TICKET_ASSIGNED notification
- [x] `B5-5` — Wire pickup SLA timer in `TicketsService.updateStatus` when transitioning to `TEAM_ASSIGNED`
- [x] `B5-6` — `workers/jobs/src/index.ts` updated: starts `slaTimersWorker` and `autoAssignWorker` on process boot, includes both in graceful shutdown

### QA Gate Checks — M3
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/queue` returns only UNASSIGNED/TEAM_ASSIGNED tickets for the auth user's team, ordered priority ASC → sla_pickup_deadline ASC
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/queue/claim/:id` blocks if engineer is at max capacity
- [ ] Claiming a ticket sets status → ASSIGNED, records history, fires TICKET_ASSIGNED notification, enqueues resolution SLA timer
- [ ] Pickup SLA timer fires after deadline; marks `sla_pickup_breached = 1`, triggers auto-assign job
- [ ] Auto-assign worker assigns to least-loaded engineer; does not exceed `max_capacity_per_engineer`
- [ ] Redis mutex prevents double-assignment when two pickup timers fire simultaneously
- [ ] Resolution SLA timer marks `sla_resolution_breached = 1`, transitions ticket → ESCALATED, notifies manager
- [ ] Queue config (per-tenant, per-team) is respected by claim and auto-assign logic
- [ ] Queue health panel shows accurate status counts and SLA breach numbers
- [ ] Claim button is disabled for engineer at capacity and while claim is in-flight

## Sprint 7 · Task Management

**Target milestone:** M4  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — branch `feature/sprint-7-tasks`

### Backend Dev Agent Jobs
- [x] `B7-1` — MSSQL schemas: `tasks`, `task_assignments`, `task_checklist_items`. Migration: `0004_task_management.sql`

- [x] `B7-3` — Task business logic: `LEAD_ASSIGNED` vs `SELF_LOGGED` source determination from role; visibility rules (engineer sees own tasks + assigned tasks; lead sees team); progress computed from checklist completion or `progressOverride`; auto-complete when all checklist items + all assignment rows done
- [x] `B7-4` — tRPC procedures: `tasks.list`, `tasks.get`, `tasks.create`, `tasks.update`, `tasks.addChecklistItem`, `tasks.toggleChecklistItem`, `tasks.complete`

### Frontend Dev Agent Jobs
- [x] `F7-1` — Tasks page (`app/(app)/tasks/page.tsx`) + `components/tasks/tasks-table.tsx`: filterable table by status + source, progress bar inline, 60s refresh, row-click opens drawer
- [x] `F7-2` — `components/tasks/task-drawer.tsx`: full task view, progress bar, live checklist with toggle + add item, assignees list per-completion, status action footer (Start / Mark Complete / Cancel)
- [x] `F7-3` — `components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx`: two-mode form (Self-log / Assign to engineers), task type select, due date picker, assignee UUID list builder

### QA Gate Checks — M4
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/tasks` with no `assigneeIds` creates `SELF_LOGGED` task owned by caller
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/tasks` with `assigneeIds` from TEAM_LEAD+ creates `LEAD_ASSIGNED` task + `Task_Assignments` rows
- [ ] Engineer attempting to assign task to others receives 400
- [ ] Engineer cannot view tasks they did not create or are not assigned to (401/403)
- [ ] Toggling all checklist items to complete sets task `status = COMPLETED`, `progress_override = 100`
- [ ] Marking own assignment complete when all assignees done → task auto-completes
- [ ] Self-logged tasks are visible to the team lead in `GET /api/v1/tasks`
- [ ] `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id/status = CANCELLED` blocks further updates
- [ ] Task drawer checklist items reflect server state immediately after toggle (optimistic invalidation)

### Backend Dev Agent Jobs

- [ ] `B8-1` — MSSQL schemas: `kpi_definitions`, `kpi_team_targets`, `kpi_engineer_assignments`, `kpi_agreements`, `kpi_agreement_areas`, `kpi_agreement_metrics`, `kpi_actuals`, `kpi_results`. Migration: `0005_kpi_engine.sql`
- [ ] `B8-2` — `KpiModule`: REST v1 — KPI Definitions CRUD (`IT_MANAGER` only): `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/kpi/definitions`; per-team target overrides: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/kpi/definitions/:id/team-targets`
- [ ] `B8-3` — Per-engineer KPI assignment REST: `GET/POST/PATCH /api/v1/kpi/assignments` (Team Lead scope — own team only); individual target overrides stored in `kpi_engineer_assignments`
- [ ] `B8-4` — KPI Agreement REST: `POST /api/v1/kpi/agreements` (create Draft), `GET /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id`, `PATCH /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id/areas` (add/update areas + metric rows), `POST /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id/submit` (Lead submits → Pending Review), `POST /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id/accept` (Engineer accepts → Active)
- [ ] `B8-5` — Document upload + column mapping: `POST /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id/upload` (parse Excel/CSV via `exceljs`; return column preview); `POST /api/v1/kpi/agreements/:id/import` (accept column mapping, insert metric rows)
- [ ] `B8-6` — KPI actuals ingestion: auto-ingest on ticket resolve (`TicketsService`) and task complete (`TasksService`) — write `kpi_actuals` row linked to the agreement metric; manual entry endpoint `POST /api/v1/kpi/actuals`
- [ ] `B8-7` — Scoring engine: `KpiScoringService` — computes weighted score per `kpi_agreement_area` and overall score for a period; stores result in `kpi_results`; callable on-demand and via BullMQ `score-period` job at period end
- [ ] `B8-8` — tRPC procedures: `kpi.definitions.list`, `kpi.assignments.list`, `kpi.agreements.list`, `kpi.agreements.get`, `kpi.results.get`, `kpi.actuals.list`

### Frontend Dev Agent Jobs

- [ ] `F8-1` — KPI Setup page (`app/(app)/kpis/page.tsx`) + `components/kpis/kpi-definitions-table.tsx`: IT_MANAGER view — definitions table with name, type, target, weight, scope; Create / Edit / Archive actions; per-team override matrix modal (reference mockup page 06)
- [ ] `F8-2` — KPI Assignments page (`components/kpis/kpi-assignments-panel.tsx`): Team Lead view — assign KPIs to engineers in own team, set individual target overrides, reference team default (reference mockup page 07)
- [ ] `F8-3` — KPI Agreement builder (`components/kpis/kpi-agreement-builder.tsx`): area groups, metric rows (description, weight, period, target), weight-sum validation (must = 100), manual entry + CSV/Excel upload with column mapping wizard, submit / accept actions (reference mockup page 08)
- [ ] `F8-4` — KPI Dashboard section (`components/kpis/kpi-dashboard.tsx`): engineer self-view — score vs target per metric, RAG (green/amber/red) indicators, trend sparklines, overall weighted score gauge; wired to `trpc.kpi.results.get` (reference mockup page 04)
- [ ] `F8-5` — tRPC hooks wiring: all `trpc.kpi.*` procedures; optimistic updates on agreement edits; 60s refresh on dashboard scores

### QA Gate Checks — M5

- [ ] `POST /api/v1/kpi/definitions` creates definition with correct `tenantId` scope; weight totals enforcement on activation
- [ ] Per-team target override is applied when `kpi_team_targets` row exists; falls back to definition default otherwise
- [ ] Engineer assignment restricted to Team Lead's own team; ENGINEER role cannot call `/api/v1/kpi/assignments`
- [ ] Agreement status machine: `Draft → Pending Review → Active`; Active agreement blocks further area/metric edits
- [ ] CSV/Excel upload: bad column mapping returns 422 with field-level errors; valid import inserts metric rows correctly
- [ ] Ticket resolve auto-writes `kpi_actuals` row if a matching active agreement metric exists for the engineer
- [ ] Task complete auto-writes `kpi_actuals` row if task has a `kpi_definition_id` linked
- [ ] Scoring engine produces correct weighted score for a sample 3-area agreement (weight totals 100)
- [ ] KPI dashboard RAG indicators: green ≥ target, amber within 10% below target, red > 10% below
- [ ] All KPI data is scoped to authenticated user's `tenantId`; no cross-tenant data leak
